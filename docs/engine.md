# Engine API

Reference for `linha_fina.engine.IntentEngine` — the high-level orchestrator
that combines the SVM classifier, template matcher, and keyword extractor.

For deeper internals see [Components](components.md). For the OVOS plugin
wrapper see [OPM pipeline](pipeline.md).

## Import

```python
from linha_fina.engine import IntentEngine, IntentMatch
```

## `IntentEngine(instant_train=False)`

Create a new engine.

| arg | type | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `instant_train` | bool | `False` | If `True`, call `train()` automatically after every `register_intent` / `register_entity`. Convenient for REPL exploration; expensive in production where you want batched registration followed by a single `train()`. |

When `instant_train=False` (the default), training is **lazy**: the engine
sets an internal "needs training" flag on each registration and only fits
when the next `calc_intent` / `predict` call is made.

## Registering intents

### `register_intent(name, samples, entity_samples=None)`

```python
eng.register_intent(
    "play",
    samples=["play {song}", "put on {song}"],
    entity_samples={"song": ["africa", "hey jude"]},
)
```

| arg | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `str` | Intent label. In the OPM pipeline this is `"{skill_id}:{intent_name}"`; in raw use any string works. |
| `samples` | `list[str]` | Example utterances. May contain `{slot}` placeholders. Templates with `[optional]` or `(alt\|alt)` syntax are auto-expanded into all permutations before being fed to the matcher. |
| `entity_samples` | `dict[str, list[str]] \| None` | Per-slot value lists used both as keyword vocabulary and as training data for the SVM (slots are filled with each value to create more positive samples). |

The samples are expanded by `templates.expand_slots` before training, so
`"play {song}"` with `entity_samples={"song": ["africa", "hey jude"]}` yields
the training corpus `["play africa", "play hey jude"]` in addition to the
template `"play {song}"` itself.

### `remove_intent(name)`

Removes the intent and its associated template matcher, keyword features,
and per-intent binary classifier. The engine is marked as needing retraining.

## Registering entities

### `register_entity(name, samples, intent_name=None)`

Add keyword values for an entity slot.

| arg | meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Entity label, e.g. `"song"`, `"color"`. |
| `samples` | List of literal strings to match. |
| `intent_name` | If given, scope the entity to that intent only. If `None`, the entity is global and may be matched for any intent that declares it as a slot. |

Useful when entity values arrive separately from intent samples — e.g. a
skill registers `"play"` at startup and pushes new songs into the `song`
entity as the user's library is indexed.

### `remove_entity(name, intent_name=None)`

Inverse of `register_entity`.

## Training

### `train()`

Fits the SVM(s) over the current intent + entity state. Idempotent and safe
to call repeatedly — the engine tracks dirty flags and skips work if nothing
changed.

Raises if fewer than 3 intents are registered (multi-class one-vs-rest
requires at least three positive classes to be meaningful).

## Inference

### `calc_intent(query) -> IntentMatch | None`

Top-1 prediction. Returns an `IntentMatch` or `None` if no intent crossed
the engine's internal floor (~0.2).

### `predict(query, top_n=3) -> list[IntentMatch]`

Top-N predictions, sorted by descending confidence. Useful for debugging,
re-ranking, or pipelines that want to consider multiple candidates.

```python
@dataclass
class IntentMatch:
    name: str                       # the intent label
    slots: dict[str, str]           # extracted slot values, may be empty
    conf: float                     # 0.0–1.0 after all boost/penalty steps
```

Confidence is computed as:

```
conf = svm_probability
       * 1.10  if keyword extractor matched any entity for this intent
       * 0.75  if the intent has templates but none of them fuzzy-matched
```

Both adjustments are multiplicative and may stack. The +10% / −25% values
are deliberate: keyword agreement is a weak corroboration (small boost),
template absence is a stronger negative signal (larger penalty).

## Full example

```python
from linha_fina.engine import IntentEngine

eng = IntentEngine(instant_train=False)

eng.register_intent(
    "play",
    ["play {song}", "put on {song}", "I want to hear {song}"],
    entity_samples={"song": ["africa", "hey jude", "wonderwall"]},
)
eng.register_intent("stop", ["stop", "shut up", "pause"])
eng.register_intent("next", ["next track", "skip", "next song"])

eng.train()

for utt in ["put on africa", "shut up", "skip this one"]:
    m = eng.calc_intent(utt)
    print(f"{utt!r:30s} → {m.name:6s} conf={m.conf:.2f} slots={m.slots}")
```

```
'put on africa'                → play   conf=0.91 slots={'song': 'africa'}
'shut up'                      → stop   conf=0.84 slots={}
'skip this one'                → next   conf=0.72 slots={}
```
